# Conversation Search Implementation

## Change Summary

**Date:** Current date
**Type:** Feature enhancement
**Files Affected:** 
- `index.html` (modified)
- `style.css` (modified)

## Description

The search functionality has been enhanced to provide a conversation-like experience. Previously, each new search would replace the previous results. Now, search results are appended to previous ones, creating a continuous conversation history where users can see all their previous queries and responses.

## Technical Details

### HTML Changes
1. Restructured the results container to use a conversation container pattern:
   ```html
   <div class="results-container" id="results">
       <div id="conversation-container">
           <!-- Search results will be appended here -->
       </div>
       
       <div id="loading-indicator-inline" class="loading-indicator-inline">
           <div class="spinner"></div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. Removed the static result elements that were previously replaced with each search.

### CSS Changes
1. Added styles for the conversation container:
   ```css
   #conversation-container {
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
       gap: 30px;
   }
   ```

2. Added styles for search result items:
   ```css
   .search-result-item {
       background-color: white;
       border-radius: 15px;
       box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
       overflow: hidden;
       margin-bottom: 30px;
   }
   ```

3. Added an inline loading indicator style:
   ```css
   .loading-indicator-inline {
       display: none;
       margin: 20px auto;
       text-align: center;
       color: #4285f4;
       padding: 20px 0;
   }
   ```

### JavaScript Changes
1. Modified `handleSearch()` to:
   - Show the inline loading indicator for subsequent searches
   - Keep previous results visible when performing a new search

2. Modified `handleSearchResults()` to:
   - Create a new result item for each search
   - Dynamically build the result DOM structure
   - Append each new result to the conversation container
   - Scroll to the new result

3. Updated `handleSearchError()` to show errors inline with other results

4. Updated the loading indicator logic to support both the main and inline indicators

## Benefits

1. **Continuous Context**: Users can see their search history and maintain context
2. **Improved Workflow**: Enables building on previous searches without losing information
3. **Better User Experience**: Provides a more natural conversation flow similar to chat interfaces
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear visual separation between different searches and their results

## Notes

- Search results are now displayed in chronological order (oldest at top, newest at bottom)
- Each search displays when it was initiated with "You asked: [query]"
- Citations/sources are displayed per search result, not globally
- The agent process visualization is still updated for each new search
- The UI maintains the same visual design language with consistent styling
