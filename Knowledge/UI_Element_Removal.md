# UI Element Removal

## Change Summary

**Date:** Current date
**Type:** UI Simplification
**Files Affected:** 
- `index.html` (modified)
- `style.css` (modified)

## Description

Two user interface elements were removed from the results display:

1. **Agent Information Text**: The "Powered by: GPT-4o Agent" text that appeared below the query text was removed. This removes technical information that most users don't need to see.

2. **New Search Button**: The "â†© New search" button was removed from the top right corner of the results display. 

## Technical Details

1. From `index.html`:
   - Removed the `<div id="agent-info">` element from the results header
   - Removed the `<button class="back-to-search">` element from the results header

2. From `style.css`:
   - Removed the `.back-to-search` and `.back-to-search:hover` CSS rules

3. From JavaScript:
   - Removed references to the `agentInfo` element
   - Removed the click event listener for the "back-to-search" button
   - Removed the code that assigned text to the agent info element

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Interface**: Less cluttered results display with focus on the content
2. **Better User Flow**: Encourages users to stay in the results view rather than starting a new search
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Fewer options for users to consider

## Notes

- Users can still initiate a new search by typing in the search box at the bottom of the screen
- The agent process visualization panel still shows which agent was used
- The query text ("You asked: ...") is still displayed above the results
