# Design Restoration

## Change Summary

**Date:** Current date
**Type:** Design adjustment
**Files Affected:** 
- `index.html` (modified)
- `style.css` (modified)

## Description

The search results design was restored to match the original cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic while maintaining the new conversation functionality. The boxed, nested design of search results was replaced with a flatter, more elegant design that aligns with the original Deep Search styling.

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
1. Removed the box styling from search result items:
   - Removed background color, border radius, and box shadow from the `.search-result-item` class
   - Restored proper margin and padding values
   - Removed the background and border from the header section

2. Restored original header and content layout:
   - Fixed padding and margin on the result header
   - Kept the boxing on the actual content rather than the entire result item
   - Moved the sources button to appear directly under the content

3. Simplified the sources container:
   - Removed the border and background styling
   - Adjusted spacing to match the original design

### JavaScript Changes
1. Updated `handleSearchResults()`:
   - Changed the DOM structure to match the original design
   - Attached the toggle sources button directly to the result item
   - Simplified the structure for citations display

2. Fixed `handleSearchError()`:
   - Updated error display to match the restored design
   - Ensured consistent styling between regular results and error messages

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Aesthetic**: Returns to the more minimal, elegant design of the original interface
2. **Improved Readability**: Content stands out better with the simplified container structure
3. **Consistent Experience**: Aligns with the rest of the application's design language
4. **Retained Functionality**: Preserves the conversation functionality while improving the visual design

## Notes

- The conversation functionality (appending results instead of replacing them) is maintained
- Each result still has its own query text and sources section as implemented in the conversation feature
- The scrolling behavior and loading indicators remain the same
- The interface is now visually closer to the original Deep Search design while benefiting from the conversation functionality
